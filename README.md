# RADIX: Root Anatomy Deep Identification across Species

RADIX is a semantic segmentation model for plant root cross-section fluorescence microscopy. It uses a DINOv3 vision transformer encoder with a DPT decoder, and outputs per-pixel labels for 7 anatomical classes: Background, Epidermis, Aerenchyma, Endodermis, Vascular, Exodermis, and Cortex. Trained on Millet, Rice, Sorghum, and Tomato roots imaged on Olympus IX83, Cytation C10, and Zeiss LSM 970 microscopes.

## Data Format

Each sample is a folder containing three grayscale 16-bit TIFs, one per fluorescence channel:

```
{sample}/
├── {sample}_DAPI.tif    # cell walls
├── {sample}_FITC.tif    # lignin
└── {sample}_TRITC.tif   # suberin
```

The filename prefix must match the folder name, and all three channels must share the same prefix. Both flat (`data_dir/sample/*.tif`) and two-level (`data_dir/group/sample/*.tif`) layouts are accepted; in the two-level case sample IDs become `{group}/{sample}`.

Images are normalized on the fly (1st-99.5th percentile per channel) and resized to 1024×1024 for inference; original resolution is preserved for downstream intensity measurements.

Optional ground-truth annotations use YOLO polygon format (`class_id x1 y1 x2 y2 ...`, normalized 0-1) with 6 raw classes: `0` Whole Root, `1` Aerenchyma, `2` Outer Endodermis, `3` Inner Endodermis, `4` Outer Exodermis, `5` Inner Exodermis. Rings are derived at load time by subtracting inner from outer polygons.

## Running RADIX on New Data

The deployment entry point is `predict.py`. It runs inference with the trained DINOv3+DPT checkpoint and writes per-sample masks, visualizations, and a measurements CSV.

1. Open `predict.py` and set the two paths at the top:

   ```python
   DATA_DIR  = Path("/path/to/samples/")   # folder of per-sample subfolders
   MODEL_DIR = Path("/path/to/run/")       # run dir (contains checkpoints/best-*.ckpt) or a .ckpt file
   ```

2. Run:

   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

3. Outputs land in `{DATA_DIR}/predictions_dinov3_dpt/` (or a custom `OUTPUT_DIR`):

   ```
   predictions/{sample}.npy   # uint8 semantic argmax (0=bg, 1=epi, 2=aer, 3=endo, 4=vasc, 5=exo, 6=cortex)
   vis/{sample}.png           # input + Bio-7 overlay
   measurements.csv           # aerenchyma_ratio + per-region DAPI/FITC/TRITC means
   ```

Requires a CUDA GPU. Environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt` in a Python 3.11 conda env.

### Evaluating against ground truth

If you have annotations and want IoU/Dice + paired GT-vs-prediction downstream comparisons, use `run_eval_pipeline.py`:

```bash
python run_eval_pipeline.py \
    --model-key timm_semantic \
    --checkpoint path/to/best.ckpt \
    --run-dir path/to/run/
```

This runs eval on the test and Zeiss oneshot splits, saves predictions as YOLO `.txt` files, then computes downstream measurements from both GT and predictions with correlation plots.

## Polygon Editor

Interactive GUI for creating, reviewing, and correcting YOLO polygon annotations.

```bash
python polygon_editor.py --data-dir path/to/data/
python polygon_editor.py                             # no args: use Browse button
```

### Vertex editing

Drag vertices to move. Hover an edge to see a green "+" marker; click to insert a vertex. Select a vertex and press Delete to remove it.

### Display sliders

Brightness (-100 to +100) and Gamma (0.1 to 3.0) affect the on-screen image only; the underlying raw TIFs are never modified.

### Saving

Press `S` to save. Annotations are written to `{data-dir}/annotation/` in YOLO polygon format, one file per sample: `{Species}_{Microscope}_{Exp}_{Sample}.txt` for the structured layout, or `{sample}.txt` for generic layouts. The folder is created if it does not exist.
